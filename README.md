# Code Samples for DevNet Express Cloud Collaboration tracks

This repository holds code samples for these two DevNet Express tracks:

* [**IT-Pros**](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/devnet-express-cloud-collab-it-pro) - folder is titled as `itp`
* [**Software Developers**](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/devnet-express-cloud-collab-soft-dev) - folder is titled as `sd`


## Guidance for Software Developers

To open the workspace, simply go to the `sd` directory and type `code soft-devs.code-workspace`.

By doing so, VSCode will load the debug options for each folder when entering debug mode (F5) without the need for you to open each folder individually with the `code .` command

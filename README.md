## Welcome to DevNet Express Cloud Collab Code Samples Repository

This repository holds code samples for these two DevNet Express tracks:

* **IT-Pros** - folder is titled as `itp`
* **Software Developers** - folder is titled as `sd`

## Guidance for Software Developers

To open the workspace, simply go to the `sd` directory and type `code soft-devs.code-workspace`.

By doing so, VSCode will load the debug options for each folder when entering debug mode (F5) without the need for you to open each folder individually with the `code .` command
